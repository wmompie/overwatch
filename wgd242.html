                <h2 class="banger">Postmortem</h2>
                <p class="banger">CSS Layouts&#58;</p>
                <p>I have had previous experience with CSS layouts even before attending this University, although as many other situations in life, one can never know it all so I have learned a thing or two throughout this course. After many chances to practice and learn the skills of layouts with margin, padding, aligning &#60;div&#62; sections and so, there will always be more to learn.</p>
                <p>For instance, I know that once a person gets the hang of using relative or absolute positioning, they are free to conquer almost anything else in their design. Layouts are an important aspect of creating a UX&#47;UI that the end user will be happy to view, use, browse, or play around with.</p>
                <p>For my <a href="ilab/week1/overwatch_template.html" class="postmortem" target="_blank">CSS Layout</a>, you can see that I chose to go with a simple basic design. Logo on the top left, Navigation in the center with a jumbotron underneath, an article section to the side for less important content, and to the left I had the major content area. </p>
                
                <p class="banger">CSS Menus&#58;</p>
                <p>CSS menus are probably the most important aspect of any web design in that it allows you to travel within the website and is what attracts most users to stay engaged while not getting lost. I have learned many new tricks with menus such as changing the appearance dramatically depending on a user action like a hover or a click. Also how to hide sub&#45;menus until an action occurs from the user to save space on your page.</p>
                <p>There are many different options you can have for a navigation menu and there are always fun and new ideas people design everyday so the limit is endless. The main focus should be to make sure there are &#34;dead end areas&#34; within your menu where the user will end up stuck somewhere on your page forcing them to leave.</p>
                <p><a href="ilab/week2/index.html" class="postmortem" target="_blank">Here</a> you can see how my layout was nearly complete with coloring and position for the remainder of the project &#40;for the most part&#41;.This is also the area I decided to implement my CSS into the menu changing the color when hovered over.</p>
                
                <p class="banger">jQuery element controls&#58;</p>
                <p class="banger2">Sliders&#58;</p>
                <p>Sliders are something I have seen done before but was a new experience for me during the assignment of the course. I love the idea of sliders and how the user can interact with it sending them off to the appropriate page. I know them better as Jumbrotrons but a name is a name I suppose. I have seen this in many websites used for companies and I believe this will be an experience I have to offer. I can see myself practicing more with the slider in personal projects I have planned. With my <a href="/ilab/week3/about.html" class="postmortem" target="_blank">Slider</a>, I decided to bring over some images from the video game that fit with the theme within each About sub&#45;page and keeping the simple metallic theme of the AnythingSlider from jQuery.</p>
                <p class="banger2">Menus&#58;</p>
                <p>Much like the CSS menus, the jQuery menus offer even more options to make the navigation more user friendly based off of user interaction. Menus are an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to the design of a web page. The elemental control I decided to use within my <a href="ilab/week4/w4_lab.html" class="postmortem" target="_blank">Menu</a> with jQuery was the change of shape during the users&#39; interaction. For instance, when hovered, the menu item would turn from an oval button into a square button while adding a border and changing the color.</p>
                <p class="banger2">Hide&#47;display items&#58;</p>
                <p>jQuery allows new fun ways to show, hide, or change an elements and is easy to import especially if using the jQuery library. Much like the menu, jQuery has been an amazing experience that allowed us to think outside of the box in what we were able to accomplish. This is also another area that would be greatly used with clients or future projects. My <a href="ilab/week4/w4_lab.html" class="postmortem" target="_blank">Dashboard</a> was very fun to work with in this area. I was allowed to hide and display the social media to the left side of the screen to only show when hovered over with the mouse.</p>
                <p class="banger2">Opacity and color controls&#58;</p>
                <p>Another area where this can be used for anything the designer pleases. For instance, I used this option in the <a href="ilab/week4/w4_lab.html" class="postmortem" target="_blank">Aside</a> where the hover would change the color from gray to yellow matching the theme of the design. This might not be an option that many clients would want outside of menus or images, but we shall see when the time comes.</p>
                
                <p class="banger">Full&#45;page scrolls&#58;</p>
                <p>Full&#45;page scrolls were another section I found to be fun. There&#39;s a lot of opportunity in there to offer for clients or future projects. The ability to convert my current &#34;normal&#34; website into a full&#45;page scroll was something I thought to be impossible yet with a little patience and code, it happened.</p>
                <p>With my <a href="/ilab/week5/scroll/w5_lab.html" class="postmortem" target="_blank">Full&#45;page scroll</a> you have not only the ability to scroll from top to bottom, but also the ability to scroll side to side. This can be used similar to how I created it where the pages top to bottom were the main pages and the areas where you were allowed to scroll left to right were sub&#45;pages. Basically a re&#45;creation of the menu mixed with the actual content.</p>
                
                <p class="banger">Responsive CSS control&#58;</p>
                <p>Responsiveness within a website is an increasingly desired option which not only clients would want, but also the designer themselves. Before responsive design, the designer would have to create the same website multiple times for different screen sizes such as one for desktop, one for tablet, and another for mobile.</p>
                <p>Responsive CSS control allowed us to create a single website that was responsive depending on the screen size of the user using different CSS rules. This interaction allows the designer to also control other areas of the design such as hiding elements, moving elements, re&#45;sizing them, and so on.</p>
                <p>In my <a href="/ilab/week6/index.html" class="postmortem" target="_blank">Responsive CSS Control</a> assignment, you can see the sizing of many elements and content changing depending on the screen size &#40;or width&#41; of your browser window&#47;viewing device. When small enough, the menu changes into a smaller interactive version allowing mobile users to still interact with the website while being able to view the content.</p>
                
                <p class="banger">Forms and form validation&#58;</p>
                <p>I believe this to be self&#45;explanatory but the short point of this is forms are very important in any web design. Forms are not the average forms people tend to think of on an everyday basis such as the ones that require you to enter payment information, but forms have evolved into things such as Twitter, Facebook, or even registration pages before entering a website.</p>
                <p>This course did not go into depth about the server side validation however I was allowed to be introduced to client side validation which can be seen <a href="/ilab/week7/w7_lab.html" class="postmortem" target="_blank">Here</a> and used in the field. There are sets of rules that the users would need to follow even before they are allowed to send the information to the server. These areas can include making sure the user does not leave any important information empty, making sure they enter a valid information, or even entering a telephone number correctly.</p>
                
                <p class="banger">Decisions for my template of Overwatch&#58;</p>
                <p>When asked to choose a theme for my project, I chose Overwatch because the game was fresh, brand new and I thought it would be a good topic to cover. Even if the information across the site was mostly Lorem Ipsum text, I found the design and theme of the project to extremely fun. The colors chosen were based off of similar colors used from the game itself. The fonts I chose were ones that I found using Google Fonts that would go well with what the game uses already. The layout chosen was mostly from the assignments as I thought those would look very nice for what I intended to do with a few minor adjustments here and there.</p>
                <p class="decision">The menu items I chose were based off of information I would have wanted the user to be engaged in when browsing the website. Many other fan sites or guides that have created content for Overwatch have something very similar where as they would want you to know about the game, offer information of each hero within the game, and content where new users would learn what the point of the game was or how it worked.</p>
                <p class="decision">When selecting which items to show/display in my website, I chose to stick with the menu and the dashboard. The menu is for obvious reasons as I would not want the end user to see the design as a basic design, instead to act responsively depending on the users&#39; interaction with the menu. When they hover, the color and shape change. When they hover over certain menu items, the sub&#45;menus appear. The same concept would go for the dashboard found in the contact page. It is well hidden however if the users wished to contact the owner, they could hover their mouse on the left side of the form and notice a pop&#45;out of social media. I also decided to hide the menu depending on the screen size and allow it to be smaller for those using smaller screens.</p>
                <p class="decision">In my full&#45;page scroll, as mentioned above, I decided to implement the menu navigation into the pages. Meaning page one would be the same as the first navigation menu, the second page would be the second navigation menu with left&#47;right pages substituting sub&#45;menu items, and so on.</p>
                <p class="decision">In the form I created in the contact page, I decided it was best to request all of the information so that it would be used or stored for later use or better interaction when sending a response email, figuratively speaking of course. </p>
                <p class="decision">My excitement of this course and knowledge I have obtained over the last few weeks have not fallen short and I will treasure every moment of it. There is much more to learn and by practicing every day, I know I will one day look back on this and laugh at how awful it might look and what I could have done better. I say this is a great stepping stone into a wonderful career that I will enjoy for a very long time in my life.</p>
